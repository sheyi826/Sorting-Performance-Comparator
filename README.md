the goal of the design is to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms. The project will provide a framework for testing and comparing the execution time of various sorting algorithms on different datasets.

Design Components

1. Sorting Algorithms
    - Implement the following sorting algorithms:
        - Bubble Sort
        - Selection Sort
        - Insertion Sort
        - Merge Sort
        - Quick Sort
        - Heap Sort
2. Comparator Framework
    - Design a framework to compare the performance of the sorting algorithms
    - Measure the execution time of each algorithm on different datasets
    - Provide a way to add new sorting algorithms and datasets
3. Dataset Generation
    - Generate random datasets of varying sizes and characteristics (e.g., already sorted, reverse sorted, random)
4. Performance Metrics
    - Measure the execution time of each algorithm on each dataset
    - Calculate statistics such as average, median, and standard deviation of execution times
5. Visualization
    - Use a visualization library (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to plot the performance results

Implementation

1. Language: Python
2. Sorting Algorithm Implementation: Implement each sorting algorithm as a separate function
3. Comparator Framework: Use a class-based approach to design the comparator framework
4. Dataset Generation: Use a library like NumPy to generate random datasets
5. Performance Metrics: Use a library like Pandas to calculate statistics
6. Visualization: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to plot the performance results

Example Code


import time
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class SortingComparator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.algorithms = {}
        self.datasets = {}

    def add_algorithm(self, name, func):
        self.algorithms[name] = func

    def add_dataset(self, name, data):
        self.datasets[name] = data

    def compare(self):
        results = {}
        for algorithm_name, algorithm_func in self.algorithms.items():
            results[algorithm_name] = {}
            for dataset_name, dataset in self.datasets.items():
                start_time = time.time()
                algorithm_func(dataset[:])
                end_time = time.time()
                results[algorithm_name][dataset_name] = end_time - start_time
        return results

# Example usage
comparator = SortingComparator()

# Add sorting algorithms
comparator.add_algorithm("Bubble Sort", bubble_sort)
comparator.add_algorithm("Quick Sort", quick_sort)

# Add datasets
comparator.add_dataset("Random", [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(1000)])
comparator.add_dataset("Sorted", list(range(1000)))

# Compare performance
results = comparator.compare()
